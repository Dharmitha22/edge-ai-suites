# Deterministic Threat Detection

Welcome to the documentation for the Deterministic Threat Detection project. This guide provides all the information you need to understand, set up, and run this Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) sample application.

This project demonstrates how to achieve deterministic, low-latency delivery of AI-processed video and sensor data in a shared network, protecting critical workloads from network congestion.
